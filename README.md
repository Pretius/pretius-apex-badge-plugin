# Cookbook 

## RDS
To add Badges to RDS tabs, set the following

| Name              | Value                                    |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Selection Type    | jQuery Selector                                   |
| jQuery Selector            | #**static_id_of_rds**_tab                                  |

## Cards

As in the picture above. 

Dynamic Action: After Region Refresh

| Name              | Value                                    |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Selection Type    | JavaScript Expression                                  |
| JavaScript Expression            | $('.t-Card:has(h3:contains("**Employees**"))')       

# Settings:

## Set Type:
* JavaScript Expression: e.g. 'Hello World'
* SQL Query: e.g SELECT 'Hello World' FROM DUAL
* PL/SQL Expression: e.g apex_string.join(apex_t_varchar2('Hello', 'World'),' ')
* PL/SQL Function e.g RETURN apex_string.format('%0 %1', 'Hello', 'World');

## Items to Submit
* Comma Delimited Page Item to submit in to session for PL/SQL Expressions/Functions

## Escape Special Characters
* Set Escape Special Characters to No to allow HTML in the Badge

## Show Spinner
* Spinner can be useful as a visual clue to the user that a value is loading. This is especially helpful when the badge requires refreshing following a dialog close or a timer/web sockets event.

## Show Zero:
* If No, then if the value equates to zero then the badge will not be shown. If Yes, the badge will show zero. Null labels never show the badge

## CSS Classes:

* Any CSS classes to style the badge. This defaults to u-hot which is one of the Universal Theme Color Modifier Classes from https://apex.oracle.com/ut/

* You can additonally add the **notification-badge-show-top** class to bubble the badge to the top
Examples

   * u-color-X (where X is between 1 and 45 e.g u-color-9 or u-color-10)
   * u-normal
   * u-hot
   * u-warning
   * u-danger
   * u-info
   * u-success

## Custom Attributes: 
* Any custom attributes e.g mysession="&SESSION."

## Element Attachment:
* Some Badges have scroll or placement issues with different positions of APEX elements.
* Use **Element** for Widget based components such as Navigation Menus, Breadcrumbs and Interactive Grid Columns.

## Horizontal Position

* Fine Tuning of the Horizontal Position to nudge the badge left/right. The default is 5, which hangs the badge just over the right hand edge of the element. Choose a lower (or negative number) to nudge it to the left or a higher/positive number to nudge it to the right.

## Vertical Position

* Fine Tuning of the Horizontal Position to nudge the badge up/down. The default is 0, which hangs the badge just over the top edge of the element. Choose a lower (or negative number) to nudge it upwards or a higher/positive number to nudge it downwards.

## Link
* URL to load when clicked

# Troubleshooting

## Badge not Showing
If a Badge does not show, try:
1. Experimenting with the **Element Attachment** setting
2. Adjust the Vertical/Horizontal fine-tuning. 
3. Add the **notification-badge-show-top** class to the **CSS Classes** section

## Scrolling Issues
If you see the Badge bouncing whilst scrolling, try:
1. Seelct **Element** for the **Element Attachment** setting. This works best with Widget based components such as Navigation Menus, Breadcrumbs and Interactive Grid Columns.
